<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I am GM Naimul Haque. I am from Bangladesh studying Computer Science and Engineering at BRAC University. I graduated from my
 high school in 2021 and college in 2023.

From a young age, I have been always fascinated by computers. I was amazed by the way it worked. I used to wonder how
it actually works. Growing up, I grew an desire to learn more and more about computers and its working mechanism. 
I found my passion towards Computer Science. Then it became a dream for me to earn a bachelor's degree in CS and learn 
more and more about the backbone of the computing world.

As a Freshman in CS program in BRAC University in Bangladesh, I am thrilled to explore the vast dimensions of computing world.
I have started to learn JAVA and taking a course from udemy on Full Stack Web Development as I want to pursue my career
on this. But back in school, I had the dream of becoming a doctor. I loved to study Biology and Human Anatomy. But after
graduating from high school, I found my passion for CS and thrived to learn more and more from the internet. Thus, there
began my journey of studying CS. People knew me as a tech savvy guy and my maths teacher discovered my passion before me.
He used to tell me to pursue CS or EEE. He used to tell me that the healthcare sector is not for me. But I used to refuse
and insisted on studying medicine. I believe that, my experience with the computer world changed me completely including my passion
and dedication. Those experiences lead me here today.

Throughout my life, I have faced different challenges including academic pressure. Although I excelled in my studies and topped 
every exam throughout my schooling life. My tendency of never giving up made me who I am today. I am grateful for the hard
times that made me stronger and better everyday. Even a year back, I couldn't imagine myself in the IT sector thriving to 
be the best. I never could have predicted that my life would lead me here. But I am grateful to everything.
